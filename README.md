# Shea Static

Static site portfolio for singer/songwriter Shenendoah Thompson. Design is dictated directly from Shenendoah, I'm just acting as a code monkey. Watch this space for what happens if I find time to mock him up a real landing page.

The live site is [https://shenendoahthompson.com/](https://shenendoahthompson.com/). This project is built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and you can inspect the package.json for the everchanging plugins that went into it.

This site has a CI/CD pipeline and automatically builds and deploys to a CDN with built-in cache invalidation and so much more, all provided for free by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Check them out if you're looking for static site hosting, they'll even hook you up with a deploy status badge, like this one:
